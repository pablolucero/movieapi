## Movie Service Engineering Coding Challenge for backend Java candidates


### Challenge

Build a REST API that returns data about movies.


### Instructions

* You may use the provided "MovieDatabaseService" class as a source of com.disney.globant.movie data. A simple class is provided to make it 
easy to integrate with whatever framework you're using. Feel free to modify the code however you like as part of your 
solution.

* Develop a REST service that returns information from the com.disney.globant.movie "database". You may use any libraries and/or 
frameworks you like. If a story is lacking in details, use your best judgement.

* You may complete any number of the stories below - they are listed in order of priority. Doing a smaller number of
stories well is more important than doing a larger number of stories. There is no particular number of stories that
are required.

* Document the build, installation, and execution processes.

* Your code should be checked into a public Git service (github.com and gitlab.com being two good choices). 
Your initial check-in must be no later than 3 hours after the start of the test; once your check-in is complete, 
send the project URL to your Studio Tech contact. 

* You do not have to be finished at this point; you may continue to check in code afterwards if you like. Please email 
your Disney contact when you are finished.
